        <h2>Saturday Market</h2>
        <h3>January 7th</h3>
        <strong class="line">On Saturday, Dilara took us to the market.</strong>
        <p>
          It is a wonderfully eclectic mix of goods from all over the world -
          delightfully random. I dusted off my bargaining skills to buy a metal
          bracelet with camels on it, and Maggie bought a lapis lazuli necklace
          from Afghanistan. In the evening, we walked along Gulf Road towards
          the marina, passed through Marina Mall, and ate dinner at a wonderful
          little cafe that we will definitely be frequenting. I’ve developed a
          slight obsession with lentil soul... maybe it’s because I miss Foco’s
          Indian lentil chili.

        <p>
          We took a catamaran from the marina to Failaka Island, where we got to
          explore a bit, relax on the beach, and go swimming. The water in the
          Gulf is incredibly still; I haven’t seen a wave yet, and when you look
          out on the horizon it seems to go forever. Something about the color
          of the water and maybe the dust in the air make it seem hazier than
          the Atlantic coast. I have some cool pictures of the city skyline as
          we returned on the boat.
        </p>
        <p>
          That night, I hung out in a cafe with two friends, drinking
          traditional lemonade with mint. It’s delicious; maybe I should send in
          a flavor suggestion to Morano Gelato? Then we drove around the city
          for a while. Cruising around is a really valid way to spend the time
          when a tank of gas costs about seven bucks.
